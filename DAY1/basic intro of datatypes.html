            There are six basic data types in JavaScript which can be divided into three main categories: primitive (or primary), composite (or reference),
             and special data types. String, Number, and Boolean are primitive data types.
              Object, Array, and Function (which are all types of objects) are composite data types. 
              Whereas Undefined and Null are special data types.
